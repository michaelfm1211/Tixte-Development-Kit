tdk.message(title, message), tdk.info(title, message), tdk.popup(title, message):
     This will display a popup message suitable for giving the user information.
tdk.alert(title, message), tdk.warning(title, message), tdk.error(title, message):
     This will display a popup message suitable for present an alert, warning, or reporting an error
     to the user

tdk.accessDenied(title, message), tdk.bad(title, message), tdk.noaccess(title, message):
     This will display a popup message suitable for present the user with a access denied message,
     or a no access message. This is best for restricting access to the user.

animate:
     This is a function the user should define. If defined it will be called repeatedly at a rate
     suitable for the user's browser. This should only be used for animation with the TDK canvas,
     for other repeated actions, use tdk.interval. Please note that this function will clear the
     canvas every time so you must repeatedly draw items to the TDK canvas. This requires the TDK
     canvas to be initialized(see: tdk.init())

tdk.interval(function(){}, seconds), tdk.interval(function(){}):
     This will do a specific task(an anonymous function, first parameter) every amount of
     seconds(number, second parameter). If only the task(an anonymous function, first parameter) is passed
     then the task will be called repeatedly at a rate suitable for the user's browser.

tdk.setColor(name):
     This will change what the color is of the objects being draw to the TDK canvas. The TDK canvas
     must be initialized(see: tdk.init());

tdk.outline(width):
     This will draw only the outline of all future shapes unless otherwise specified(see:
     tdk.fill()). The width parameter will determine how thick the outlines should be.

tdk.fill():
     This will draw the entire of all future shapes unless otherwise specified(see: tdk.outline())

tdk.rect(x, y, width, height):
     This will draw a rectangle on the TDK canvas. The first parameter is the x coordinate. The x
     coordinate should be between 0-100, 0 being center and 100 being fully right. The second
     parameter is the y coordinate. The y coordinate should be between 0-100, 0 being center
     and 100 being fully bottom. The third parameter is the width. The width should be between
     0-100, 0 being nothing and 100 being edge to edge. The fourth parameter is the height. The
     height should be between 0-100, 0 being nothing and 100 being edge to edge. The TDK canvas
     must be initialized(see: tdk.init());

tdk.circle(x, y, radius):
     This will draw a circle on the TDK canvas. The first parameter is the x coordinate. The x
     coordinate should be between 0-100, 0 being center and 100 being fully right. The second
     parameter is the y coordinate. The y coordinate should be between 0-100, 0 being center
     and 100 being fully bottom. The third parameter is the radius. The radius should be between
     0-100, 0 being nothing and 100 being edge to edge. The TDK canvas must be initialized(see:
     tdk.init());

tdk.shape(points):
     This will draw an irregular shape. The only parameter is an array of points. The array passed
     into the function should consist of arrays. Each array inside the array should represent a
     point. For example drawing a triangle may look like this: 
     tdk.shape([ [-20, -20], [-20, 20], [20, 0] ])

tdk.line(point1, point2, lineWid):
     This will draw a line. The first parameter should be an array representing the first/starting 
     point. The second parameter should be an array representing the second/ending point. The last 
     parameter should be the line width. For example a strait line may look like this: 
     tdk.line([-20, 0], [20, 0], 5)

tdk.image(x, y, url):
     This will draw a image on the TDK canvas. The first parameter is the x coordinate. The x
     coordinate should be between 0-100, 0 being center and 100 being fully right. The second
     parameter is the y coordinate. The y coordinate should be between 0-100, 0 being center
     and 100 being fully bottom. The third parameter is the URL of the image you want to
     display in a String.
